LaTeX notes from a variety of Princeton Computer Science courses, including:

- [COS 432: Information Security](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall14/cos432/info.html) \[Fall 2014\], with Professor Edward Felten.
- [COS 597E: Bitcoin & Cryptocurrency Technologies](http://randomwalker.info/teaching/fall-2014-bitcoin/) \[Fall 2014\], with Professor Arvind Narayanan.

(Note that I only began TeXing my course notes this year; hence the lack of content.)

For convenience, I've included both the source TeX file and the output PDF.
